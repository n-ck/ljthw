The Process:

1. Make a ToDo list
2. Pick one ToDo and a code file
3. Write out descriptive comments
4. Convert the descriptive comments to pseudo code
5. Convert the p-code to real code
6. Test the code
7. Clean up the p-code
8. Repeat


1. Make a ToDo list:
- Make a list of things you need to do for that day
- They should be short and to the point
- Listing the as steps the software needs to follow works very well
- Or: random ideas and brainstorming
- Be sure to throw out things you don't really need to do

2. Pick 1 ToDO and a .JS file
- Choose the easiest and obvious task to do
- Create or open the code files you need
- It sounds dumb, but just doing that is hard enough for some people
- If you want to code a task, you need a file

3. Write out descriptive comments
- Think "In order for code.js to do 'Task 1' this code must do..."

4. Convert the descriptive comments to pseudo-code
- Also called p-code
- It's basically loose quick to write kind of code comment for what needs to happen

5. Convert the p-code to JS
- You then go through each p-code comment and write the JavaScript under it, run it, and test that it works
- Repeat this until you have the JS file all filled in 

Exercise: Cat to-do list:
1. Get files from command line
2. Open the files
3. Print the files out
4. Print errors if the files don't exist
5. Open a file (cat.js or code.js)
6. Run the file, to make sure you can run it
7.
